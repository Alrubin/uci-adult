The adult UCI dataset is one of the most popular datasets for feature engineering and binary classification practice. The dataset contains a mix of categorical and numeric type data regarding the census and the usual aim is to predict the potential income of a person, in particular if it is greater or smaller than 50.000 dollars a year.

For sake of clearness we have divided the project into two steps:

1. *Explorative Data Analysis*
2. *Model Training and Model Evaluation*

In the first part we proceed with data acquisition and exploration, with suitable visualizations strategies for qualitative and quantitative columns and with particular care of fetching missing values. In the second part we suitably fill the missing values, we properly clean the data according to previous analysis and train various Machine Learning predicting models evaluating their performances according to different metrics (accuracy, precision, recall ...)
